# Worksheet on Java Reflection

This worksheet  is on Java Reflection.
You should commit your changes regularly. 
Where the questions make incremental changes to the code you do not need to keep separate versions of 
your code, as your commits will deal with that situation.

## Java Reflection

You should create your code under the directory `src/main/java/reflection`.

The *Reflection API* allows a Java program to inspect and manipulate itself; 
it comprises the `java.lang.Class` class and the `java.lang.reflect` package, which 
represents the members of a class with `Method`, `Constructor`, and `Field` objects.

1. Write a Java program that reads the name of a class from the command line and emits the interface 
   of the class in Java syntax (interface or class, modifiers, constructors, methods, fields; 
   no method bodies).
   
   **Hint**: You can load a class whose name you know with `java.lang.Class.forName()`. 
   The `java.lang.Class` class offers a rich interface that enables you to inspect the interface of any class.
   
   Apply this program to a set of classes and interfaces as test input. You may also use the program on itself.
   
2. Write a program that reads a class name and a list of arguments, and creates an object of that class 
   where the read arguments are passed to the constructor.
   
   **Hint**: Treat arguments as strings. A `java.lang.Class` can enumerate its constructors. 
   Choose a constructor with the appropriate parameter count, then find the parameter types. 
   To create typed argument objects, call the appropriate constructors that take a string as 
   their only argument. You can call dynamic constructors using
   
   ```
   java.lang.reflect.Constructor.newInstance()
   ```
   
3. Write a JUnit test to help grade the internal correctness of a student’s 
   submitted program for a hypothetical assignment.
   
   Make the tests fail if the class under test has any of the following:
   + more than four fields
   + any non-private fields
   + any fields of type `ArrayList`
   + fewer than two private *helper* methods 
   + any method that has a `throws` clause 
   + any method that returns an `int`
   + missing a zero-argument constructor
   
4. Usually it is up to the programmer to write a `toString()` method for each class one creates. 
   This exercise is about writing a general `toString` method once and for all. 
   As part of the reflection API for java, it is possible to find out which fields exist for a given object, 
   and to get their values. 
   
   The purpose of this exercise is to write a `toString` method that gives a printed representation of 
   any object, in such a manner that all fields are printed, and references to other objects are 
   handled as well. To solve this exercise, you will need to examine the `java.lang.reflect` API in detail. 
   You will (probably) end up with around 50–60 lines of code, including that necessary for trying this out.
